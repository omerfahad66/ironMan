        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The
            character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by
            artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover
            dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). Also in 1963, the character founded
            the Avengers alongside Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.

            A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony
            Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him
            to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and
            escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed
            through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron
            Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron
            Man.
